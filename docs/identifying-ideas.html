					<b>Identifying Ideas</b>
				</p>

				<p>Your perspective on problems is critical. Instead of treating a problem as an obstacle, it is important to treat it as an opportunity instead.</p>
<p>People often try to come up with ideas by creating solutions <em>first</em> and then seeing what problems it solves <em>after</em>. This process is the <em>opposite</em> of how to find a plausible idea.</p>
<p>A while ago, I began working on a web application. The code became extremely bloated, and the user interface was painfully slow. Instead of viewing this as an obstacle, I saw it as an opportunity. I set out to create a minimal, blazing fast user interface library that worked for me, and it turned into <a href="https://kbrsh.github.io/moon">Moon</a>.</p>
<p>It may seem like you can&#39;t find a problem with your daily life. That&#39;s because you need to change your perspective on things. A problem often won&#39;t be hard to find. Excellent ideas are always hiding in <em>plain sight</em>.</p>
<p>These unique ideas are ones that solve a problem that a lot of people have. In hindsight, these are the types of ideas that seem the most obvious.</p>
<p>Many creators automate tasks that they regularly encounter every day (especially developers). Attempt to find what&#39;s missing from your daily life. If there is a repetitive task that you frequently find yourself running into, ask yourself — <em>Can I automate this?</em></p>
<p>Be aware of your surroundings. Instead of just dealing with the reality of something annoying you, <em>notice it as an opportunity</em>. Most will overlook any inefficiencies in what they do. Instead, it&#39;s crucial to see how the current situation can be improved.</p>
<p>Question everything about the world.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Why is this done like that?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Why does this have to be so inefficient?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Why is this step necessary?</em></p></li></ul>
<p>After asking enough questions like this, your brain will begin to do it automatically. You&#39;ll notice more and more problems about your life. A constant stream of ideas will start to flow through your head.</p>
<p>A problem might seem too small to solve, but it usually isn&#39;t. A &quot;little&quot; problem can often be expanded or marketed to a select group of people. Don&#39;t dismiss an idea just because it seems like it only applies to you; there are almost always more individuals with the same problem.</p>
<p>After you&#39;ve found the problem, analyze it. There are multiple questions that you should ask yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Is there already a solution? Can it be improved?</em></p></li><li><p><em>How can it be more efficient?</em></p></li><li><p><em>How can a product help solve this?</em></p></li><li><p><em>What makes this problem worthy of addressing?</em></p></li></ul>
<p>Once you start to answer these questions, you&#39;ll naturally find a solution to the problem. Your perspective of the problem changed, and it is now an opportunity for a product.</p>
<p>After you have a relevant problem along with a solution, <em>write it down</em>. Having the solution to a problem means that you have an idea, and you should always write these down <em>no matter what</em>.</p>
<p>Keeping track of your problems and possible solutions can help you find inspiration for even more ideas. On top of that, you&#39;ll be able to pick and choose what problem you want to solve and when you want to build it.</p>
<p>Find problems you face and turn them into an opportunity. An idea should contribute to improving lives by solving a meaningful problem that you are passionate about addressing.</p>
